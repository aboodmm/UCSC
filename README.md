## A basic android Google Maps project that makes use of a REST API to update info on interesting locations marked on the UCSC campus  

We want to make it easy for people that are new to UCSC (or not-so-new) to be able to find all of the cool hidden treasures around campus and visit them. We have such a cool campus, let's help others learn about it! Ideally this project will be social and easily portable to other platforms (though for the five weeks we have, we'll stick with just Android).

## Project members:

- Jared Jensen (PO) (jaanjens@ucsc.edu)
- Eric Shi (eshi@ucsc.edu)
- Anna Andresen (anandres@ucsc.edu)
- Abdul Mohamed (abmmoham@ucsc.edu)
- Esteban Quijada (eaquijad@ucsc.edu)
